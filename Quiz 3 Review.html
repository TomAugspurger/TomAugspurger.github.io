    <p>Take a look a ICON for the solutions on this one. There's a brief explanation of each answer. It's harder to give feedback on this one since it's multiple choice, so email me if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Remember that this week's homework was over <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span> and two-means. This quiz only covered <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span>, so make sure you figure out if you understand two-means.</p>
<h2>#1</h2>
<p>This is the mathy way of writing that <code>Wine choice</code> and <code>Music</code> are unrelated: the type of music playing doesn't affect the type of wine you buy: <span class="math">\(p_{11} = p_{21} = p_{31}\)</span>. The first subscript represent the type of wine and the second represents the type of music.</p>
<h2>#6 &amp; #7</h2>
<p>For these two you need to figure out which output to use. You can tell by the numbers put in Minitab for the # of events and # of trials. Make sure that they line up with the definitions of <span class="math">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_2\)</span>: so for #6 we have <span class="math">\(p_1\)</span>: the proportion of all wines bought while French music are playing that are French.</p>

<h1>B42<a name="sectionB42"></a></h1>
<p>Remember that this week's homework was over <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span> and two-means. This quiz only covered two-means, so make sure you figure out if you understand <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span>.</p>
<h2>#1</h2>
<p>Step 1 still includes defining parameters. A lot of people didn't.
Were you confused by <span class="math">\(\chi^2\)</span>? We don't <em>usually</em> define them there (or in ANOVA) since there are usually so many.
But with 2 means we can define the 2 means <span class="math">\(\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mu_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This one was independent (not paired) since the 70 men and 70 women were each randomly sampled from their own populations. There's no reason to link up <code>man #1</code> with <code>women #1</code> rather than some other. A couple of examples of how this <em>could</em> have been setup as a paired problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>each man and woman is a fraternal twin, and their sibling of the opposite sex is also in the survey. Then we pair <strong>by twin</strong>.</li>
<li>The 70 men and 70 women are put into study pairs at the beginning of the semester. Then we pair by <strong>study pair</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#2</h2>
<p>In this problem, <code>The sample evidence supports the null hypothesis</code> is only true when <span class="math">\(\bar{x}_1 = \bar{x}_2\)</span> (since <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\mu_1 = \mu_2\)</span>). <em>Anything</em> else is evidence against <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> and in favor of <span class="math">\(H_a\)</span>. The only remaining question is whether there's just some sample evidence against <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span>, or enough sample evidence against <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> that we are comfortable rejecting it, in favor of <span class="math">\(H_a\)</span>.</p>
<h2>#3</h2>
<p>A lot of people were trying to talk about the <em>people</em> differing. Something like <code>between 17% to 43.1% men differ from women</code>. Or <code>between 17% fewer to 43.1% more men than women have a better GPA</code>. That's wrong.
Our CI is for the value <span class="math">\(\mu_1 - \mu_2\)</span>, the difference in the two means, <em>i.e.</em> the difference in the two average GPAs. So we're 99% confident that the mean GPA for men is between 17 points lower to 43.1 points higher than the mean GPA for women.</p>
