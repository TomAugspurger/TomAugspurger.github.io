I wrote up a quick [introduction to stac-geoparquet](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2024/08/introduction-to-stac-geoparquet/) on the Cloud Native Geo blog with [Kyle Barron](https://kylebarron.dev/) and [Chris Holmes](https://beta.source.coop/cholmes).

The key takeaway:

> STAC GeoParquet offers a very convenient and high-performance way to distribute large STAC collections, provided the items in that collection are pretty homogenous
