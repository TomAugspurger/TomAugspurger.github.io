Mike Duncan is wrapping up his excellent [Revolutions](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) podcast. If you're at all interested in history then now is a great time to pick it up. He takes the concept of "a revolution" and looks at it through the lens of a bunch of revolutions throughout history. The appendix episodes from the last few weeks have really tied things together, looking at whats common (and not) across all the revolutions covered in the series.

It's hard to believe that this podcast started in 2013. I came over from Mike's [The History of Rome](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com) podcast (which started in 2007(!) I'm not sure when I got on that train, but it was in the manually sync podcasts to an iPod days). Congrats to Mike for a podcast well done!
