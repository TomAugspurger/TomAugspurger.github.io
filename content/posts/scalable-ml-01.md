*This work is supported by [Anaconda Inc.] and the Data Driven Discovery
Initiative from the [Moore Foundation].*

Anaconda is interested in scaling the scientific python ecosystem. My current
focus is on out-of-core, parallel, and distributed machine learning. This series
of posts will introduce those concepts, explore what we have available today,
and track the community's efforts to push the boundaries.

*You can download a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the analysis [here][notebook].*

## Constraints

I am (or was, anyway) an economist, and economists like to think in terms of
constraints. How are we constrained by scale? The two main ones I can think of
are

1. **I'm constrained by size**: My training dataset fits in RAM, but I have to
   predict for a much larger dataset. Or, my training dataset doesn't even fit
   in RAM. *I'd like to scale out by adopting algorithms that work in batches
   locally, or on a distributed cluster.*
2. **I'm constrained by time**: I'd like to fit more models (think
   hyper-parameter optimization or ensemble learning) on my dataset in a given
   amount of time. *I'd like to scale out by fitting more models in parallel,
   either on my laptop by using more cores, or on a cluster.*

These aren't mutually exclusive or exhaustive, but they should serve as a nice
framework for our discussion. I'll be showing where the usual pandas +
scikit-learn for in-memory analytics workflow breaks down, and offer some
solutions for scaling out to larger problems.

This post will focus on cases where your *training* dataset fits in memory, but
you must predict on a dataset that's larger than memory. Later posts will
explore into parallel, out-of-core, and distributed training of machine learning
models.

## Don't forget your Statistics

Statistics is a thing[^*]. Statisticians have thought a lot about things like
sampling and the variance of estimators. So it's worth stating up front that
you may be able to just

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dataset
ORDER BY random()
LIMIT 10000;
```

and fit your model on a (representative) subset of your data. *You may not need
distributed machine learning*. The tricky thing is selecting how large your
sample should be. The "correct" value depends on the complexity of your learning
task, the complexity of your model, and the nature of your data. The best you
can do here is think carefully about your problem and to plot the [learning
curve].

![scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_learning_curve_001.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> <a
  href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_learning_curve_001.png"><i>source</i></a>
</div>

As usual, the scikit-learn developers do a great job explaining the concept in
addition to providing a great library. I encourage you to follow [that
link][learning curve]. This gist is that—for some models on some
datasets—training the model on more observations doesn't improve performance. At
some point the learning curve levels off and you're just wasting time and money
training on those extra observations.

For today, we'll assume that we're on the flat part of the learning curve. Later
in the series we'll explore cases where we run out of RAM before the learning
curve levels off.

## Fit, Predict

In my experience, the first place I bump into RAM constraints is when my
training dataset fits in memory, but I have to make predictions for a dataset
that's orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, I fit my model like normal,
and do my predictions out-of-core (without reading the full dataset into memory
at once).

We'll see that the training side is completely normal (since everything fits in
RAM). We'll see that [dask] let's us write normal-looking pandas and NumPy code,
so we don't have to worry about writing the batching code ourself.

To make this concrete, we'll use the (tried and true) New York City taxi
dataset. The goal will be to predict if the passenger leaves a tip. We'll train
the model on a single month's worth of data (which fits in my laptop's RAM), and
predict on the full dataset[^2].

Let's load in the first month of data from disk:

```python
dtype = {
    'vendor_name': 'category',
    'Payment_Type': 'category',
}

df = pd.read_csv("data/yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv", dtype=dtype,
                 parse_dates=['Trip_Pickup_DateTime', 'Trip_Dropoff_DateTime'],)
df.head()
```

The January 2009 file has about 14M rows, and pandas takes about a minute to
read the CSV into memory. We'll do the usual train-test split:

```python
X = df.drop("Tip_Amt", axis=1)
y = df['Tip_Amt'] > 0

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

print("Train:", len(X_train))
print("Test: ", len(X_test))
```

    Train: 10569309
    Test:  3523104

## Aside on Pipelines

The first time you're introduced to scikit-learn, you'll typically be shown how
you pass two NumPy arrays `X` and `y` straight into an estimator's `.fit`
method.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

est = LinearRegression()
est.fit(X, y)
```

Eventually, you might want to use some of scikit-learn's pre-processing methods.
For example, we might impute missing values with the median and normalize the
data before handing it off to `LinearRegression`. You could do this "by hand":


```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer, StandardScaler

imputer = Imputer(strategy='median')
X_filled = imputer.fit_transform(X, y)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = X_scaler.fit_transform(X_filled, y)

est = LinearRegression()
est.fit(X_scaled, y)
```

We set up each step, and manually pass the data through: `X -> X_filled ->
X_scaled`.

The downside of this approach is that we now have to remember which
pre-processing steps we did, and in what order. The pipeline from raw data to
fit model is spread across multiple python objects. A better approach is to use
scikit-learn's `Pipeline` object.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

pipe = make_pipeline(
    Imputer(strategy='median'),
    StandardScaler(),
    LinearRegression()
)
pipe.fit(X, y)
```

Each step in the pipeline implements the `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform`
methods. Scikit-learn takes care of shepherding the data through the various
transforms, and finally to the estimator at the end. Pipelines have many
benefits but the main one for our purpose today is that it packages our entire
task into a single python object. Later on, our `predict` step will be a single
function call, which makes scaling out to the entire dataset extremely
convenient.

If you want more information on `Pipeline`s, check out the [scikit-learn
docs][pipelines-docs], [this blog][pipelines-blog] post, and my talk from
[PyData Chicago 2016][pipelines-pandas]. We'll be implementing some custom ones,
which is *not* the point of this post. Don't get lost in the weeds here, I only
include this section for completeness.

## Our Pipeline

This isn't a perfectly clean dataset, which is nice because it gives us a chance
to demonstrate some pandas' pre-processing prowess, before we hand the data
of to scikit-learn to fit the model.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
# We'll use FunctionTransformer for simple transforms
from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer
# TransformerMixin gives us fit_transform for free
from sklearn.base import TransformerMixin
```

There are some minor differences in the spelling on "Payment Type":

```python
df.Payment_Type.cat.categories
```

    Index(['CASH', 'CREDIT', 'Cash', 'Credit', 'Dispute', 'No Charge'], dtype='object')

We'll reconcile that by lower-casing everything with a `.str.lower()`. But
resist the temptation to just do that imperatively inplace! We'll package it up
into a function that will later be wrapped up in a [FunctionTransformer].

```python
def payment_lowerer(X):
    return X.assign(Payment_Type=X.Payment_Type.str.lower())
```

I should note here that I'm using
[`.assign`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html)
to update the variables since it implicitly copies the data. We don't want to
be modifying the caller's data without their consent.

Not all the columns look useful. We could have easily solved this by only
reading in the data that we're actually going to use, but let's solve it now
with another simple transformer:

```python
class ColumnSelector(TransformerMixin):
    "Select `columns` from `X`"
    def __init__(self, columns):
        self.columns = columns

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self

    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        return X[self.columns]
```

Internally, pandas stores `datetimes` like `Trip_Pickup_DateTime` as a 64-bit
integer representing the nanoseconds since some time in the 1600s. If we left
this untransformed, scikit-learn would happily transform that column to its
integer representation, which may not be the most meaningful item to stick in
a linear model for predicting tips. A better feature might the hour of the day:

```python
class HourExtractor(TransformerMixin):
    "Transform each datetime in `columns` to integer hour of the day"
    def __init__(self, columns):
        self.columns = columns

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self

    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        return X.assign(**{col: lambda x: x[col].dt.hour
                           for col in self.columns})
```

Likewise, we'll need to ensure the categorical variables (in a statistical
sense) are categorical dtype (in a pandas sense). We want categoricals so that
we can call `get_dummies` later on without worrying about missing or extra
categories in a subset of the data throwing off our linear algebra (See my
[talk][pipelines-pandas] for more details).


```python
class CategoricalEncoder(TransformerMixin):
    """
    Convert to Categorical with specific `categories`.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> CategoricalEncoder({"A": ['a', 'b', 'c']}).fit_transform(
    ...     pd.DataFrame({"A": ['a', 'b', 'a', 'a']})
    ... )['A']
    0    a
    1    b
    2    a
    3    a
    Name: A, dtype: category
    Categories (2, object): [a, b, c]
    """
    def __init__(self, categories):
        self.categories = categories
        
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self
        
    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        X = X.copy()
        for col, categories in self.categories.items():
            X[col] = X[col].astype('category').cat.set_categories(categories)
        return X
```

Finally, we'd like to normalize the quantitative subset of the data.
Scikit-learn has a [StandardScaler], which we'll mimic here, to just operate on
a subset of the columns.

```python
class StandardScaler(TransformerMixin):
    "Scale a subset of the columns in a DataFrame"
    def __init__(self, columns):
        self.columns = columns
    
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Yes, non-ASCII symbols can be a valid identfiers in python 3
        self.μs = X[self.columns].mean()
        self.σs = X[self.columns].std()
        return self

    def transform(self, X, y=None):
        X = X.copy()
        X[self.columns] = X[self.columns].sub(self.μs).div(self.σs)
        return X
```

Side-note: I'd like to repeat my desire for a library of `Transformers` that
work well on NumPy arrays, dask arrays, pandas `DataFrame`s and dask dataframes.
I think that'd be a popular library. Essentially everything we've written could
go in there and be imported.

Now we can build up the pipeline:

```python
# The columns at the start of the pipeline
columns = ['vendor_name', 'Trip_Pickup_DateTime',
           'Passenger_Count', 'Trip_Distance',
           'Payment_Type', 'Fare_Amt', 'surcharge']

# The mapping of {column: set of categories}
categories = {
    'vendor_name': ['CMT', 'DDS', 'VTS'],
    'Payment_Type': ['cash', 'credit', 'dispute', 'no charge'],
}

scale = ['Trip_Distance', 'Fare_Amt', 'surcharge']

pipe = make_pipeline(
    ColumnSelector(columns),
    HourExtractor(['Trip_Pickup_DateTime']),
    FunctionTransformer(payment_lowerer, validate=False),
    CategoricalEncoder(categories),
    FunctionTransformer(pd.get_dummies, validate=False),
    StandardScaler(scale),
    LogisticRegression(),
)
pipe
```

    [('columnselector', <__main__.ColumnSelector at 0x1a2c726d8>),
     ('hourextractor', <__main__.HourExtractor at 0x10dc72a90>),
     ('functiontransformer-1', FunctionTransformer(accept_sparse=False,
               func=<function payment_lowerer at 0x17e0d5510>, inv_kw_args=None,
               inverse_func=None, kw_args=None, pass_y='deprecated',
               validate=False)),
     ('categoricalencoder', <__main__.CategoricalEncoder at 0x11dd72f98>),
     ('functiontransformer-2', FunctionTransformer(accept_sparse=False,
               func=<function get_dummies at 0x10f43b0d0>, inv_kw_args=None,
               inverse_func=None, kw_args=None, pass_y='deprecated',
               validate=False)),
     ('standardscaler', <__main__.StandardScaler at 0x162580a90>),
     ('logisticregression',
      LogisticRegression(C=1.0, class_weight=None, dual=False, fit_intercept=True,
               intercept_scaling=1, max_iter=100, multi_class='ovr', n_jobs=1,
               penalty='l2', random_state=None, solver='liblinear', tol=0.0001,
               verbose=0, warm_start=False))]

We can fit the pipeline as normal:

```python
%time pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

This take about a minute on my laptop. We can check the accuracy (but again,
this isn't the point)

```python
>>> pipe.score(X_train, y_train)
0.9931

>>> pipe.score(X_test, y_test)
0.9931
```

It turns out people essentially tip if and only if they're paying with a card,
so this isn't a particularly difficult task. Or perhaps more accurately, tips
are only *recorded* when someone pays with a card.

## Scaling Out with Dask

OK, so we've fit our model and it's been basically normal. Maybe we've been
overly-dogmatic about doing *everything* in a pipeline, but that's just good
model hygiene anyway.

Now, to scale out to the rest of the dataset. We'll predict the probability of
tipping for every cab ride in the dataset (bearing in mind that the full dataset
doesn't fit in my laptop's RAM, so we'll do it out-of-core).

To make things a bit easier we'll use dask, though it isn't strictly necessary
for this section. It saves us from writing a for loop (big whoop). Later on well
see that we can, reuse this code when we go to scale out to a cluster (that part
is pretty cool, actually). Dask can scale down to a single laptop, and up to
thousands of cores.

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv("data/*.csv", dtype=dtype,
                 parse_dates=['Trip_Pickup_DateTime', 'Trip_Dropoff_DateTime'],)

X = df.drop("Tip_Amt", axis=1)
```

`X` is a `dask.dataframe`, which can be mostly be treated like a pandas
dataframe (internally, operations are done on many smaller dataframes). `X` has
about 170M rows (compared with the 14M for the training dataset).

Since scikit-learn isn't dask-aware, we can't simply call
`pipe.predict_proba(X)`. At some point, our `dask.dataframe` would be cast to a
`numpy.ndarray`, and our memory would blow up. Fortunately, dask has some nice
little escape hatches for dealing with functions that know how to operate on
NumPy arrays, but not dask objects. In this case, we'll use `map_partitions`.

```python
yhat = X.map_partitions(lambda x: pd.Series(pipe.predict_proba(x)[:, 1],
                                            name='yhat'),
                        meta=('yhat', 'f8'))
```

`map_partitions` will go through each partition in your dataframe (one per
file), calling the function on each partition. Dask worries about stitching
together the result (though we provide a hint with the `meta` keyword, to say
that it's a `Series` with name `yhat` and dtype `f8`).

Now we can write it out to disk (using parquet rather than CSV, because CSVs are
evil).

```python
yhat.to_frame().to_parquet("data/predictions.parq")
```

This takes about 9 minutes to finish on my laptop.

## Scaling Out (even further)

If 9 minutes is too long, and you happen to have a cluster sitting around, you
can repurpose that dask code to run on the [distributed scheduler]. I'll use
[dask-kubernetes], to start up a cluster on Google Cloud Platform, but you could
also use [dask-ec2] for AWS, or [dask-drmaa] or [dask-yarn] if already have
access to a cluster from your business or institution.

```python
dask-kubernetes create scalable-ml
```

This sets up a cluster with 8 workers and 54 GB of memory.

The next part of this post is a bit fuzzy, since your teams will probably have
different procedures and infrastructure around persisting models. At my old job,
I wrote a small utility for serializing a scikit-learn model along with some
metadata about what it was trained on, before dumping it in S3. If you want to
be fancy, you should watch [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKU8MWORHP8)
by [Rob Story](https://twitter.com/oceankidbilly) on how Stripe handles these things
(it's a bit more sophisticated than my "dump it on S3" script).

For this blog post, "shipping it to prod" consists of a `joblib.dump(pipe,
"taxi-model.pkl")` on our laptop, and copying it to somewhere the cluster can
load the file. Then on the cluster, we'll load it up, and create a `Client` to
communicate with our cluster's workers.

```python
from distributed import Client
from sklearn.externals import joblib

pipe = joblib.load("taxi-model.pkl")
c = Client('dask-scheduler:8786')
```

Depending on how your cluster is set up, specifically with respect to having a
shared-file-system or not, the rest of the code is more-or-less identical. If
we're using S3 or Google Cloud Storage as our shared file system, we'd modify
the loading code to read from S3 or GCS, rather than our local hard drive:

```python
df = dd.read_csv("s3://bucket/yellow_tripdata_2009*.csv",
                 dtype=dtype,
                 parse_dates=['Trip_Pickup_DateTime', 'Trip_Dropoff_DateTime'],
                 storage_options={'anon': True})
df = c.persist(df)  # persist the dataset in distributed memory
                    # across all the workers in the Dataset
X = df.drop("Tip_Amt", axis=1)
y = df['Tip_Amt'] > 0
```

Computing the predictions is identical to our out-of-core-on-my-laptop code:


```python
yhat = X.map_partitions(lambda x: pd.Series(pipe.predict_proba(x)[:, 1], name='yhat'),
                        meta=('yhat', 'f8'))
```

And saving the data (say to S3) might look like

```python
yhat.to_parquet("s3://bucket/predictions.parq")
```

The loading took about 4 minutes on the cluster, the predict about 10 seconds,
and the writing about 1 minute. Not bad overall.

## Wrapup

Today, we went into detail on what's potentially the first scaling problem
you'll hit with scikit-learn: you can train your dataset in-memory (on a laptop,
or a large workstation), but you have to predict on a much larger dataset.

We saw that the existing tools handle this case quite well. For training, we
followed best-practices and did everything inside a `Pipeline` object. For
predicting, we used `dask` to write regular pandas code that worked out-of-core
on my laptop or on a distributed cluster.

If this topic interests you, you should watch [this talk][civis-scaling-sklearn]
by [Stephen Hoover] on how Civis is scaling scikit-learn.

In future posts we'll dig into

- how dask can speed up your existing pipelines by executing them in parallel
- scikit-learn's out of core API for when your training dataset doesn't fit in
  memory
- using dask to implement distributed machine learning algorithms

Until then I would *really* appreciate your feedback. My personal experience
using scikit-learn and pandas can't cover the diversity of use-cases they're
being thrown into. You can reach me on Twitter
