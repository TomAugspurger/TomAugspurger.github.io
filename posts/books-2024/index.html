The Soul of a New Machine, by Tracy Kidder

I technically read it in the last few days of 2023, but included here because I
liked it so much. This came recommended by the Oxide and Friends podcast&rsquo;s
Books in the Box
episode. I didn&rsquo;t know a ton about the history of computing, but have been
picking up an appreciation for it thanks to reading this book. It goes into a
ton of detail about what it took Data General to design and release a new
machine. Highly recommended to anyone interested in computing."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://tomaugspurger.net/posts/books-2024/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.ced21e6d3497ee93fed8f8b357448095840179bd510b5ea0e6013078712e6dd1.css integrity="sha256-ztIebTSX7pP+2PizV0SAlYQBeb1RC16g5gEweHEubdE=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.f413e19d0714851f6474e7ee9632408e58ac146fbdbe62747134bea2fa3415e0.js integrity="sha256-9BPhnQcUhR9kdOfuljJAjlisFG+9vmJ0cTS+ovo0FeA=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://tomaugspurger.net/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://tomaugspurger.net/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://tomaugspurger.net/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://tomaugspurger.net/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://tomaugspurger.net/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://tomaugspurger.net/posts/books-2024/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--hljs-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="My 2024 Year in Books"><meta property="og:description" content="Here&rsquo;s another Year in Books (I missed last year, but here&rsquo;s 2022).

It goes into a ton of detail about what it took Data General to design and release a new machine. Highly recommended to anyone interested in computing.\nMore Murderbot Diaries I got caught up on Martha Well’s Murderbot Diaries series, finishing both Fugitive Telemetry and System Collapse. These continue to be so enjoyable. (This Wired piece about Martha Wells and the series is in my reading list).\nNona the Ninth, by Tamsyn Muir This is third installment in her Locked Tomb series. I don’t remember a ton of details from the plot, but I do recall\nThis feeling very different from the previous entries (each of which felt different from their predecessors) A general feeling of discomfort and tension, like things could explode at any time, which I think was deliberate It’s not as simple to describe as “lesbian necromancers in space” like the Gideon the First, but overall, I enjoyed it.\nThe Cemeteries of Amalo series, by Katherine Addison These are set in the same universe as The Goblin Emperor, but follow a different main character. I didn’t love these quite as much as The Goblin Emperor (which is just… perfect), but the writing in these is still great. Don’t expect a ton from the plot. These are still more about the world and characters moving through it than anything else.\nThe Hunt for Red October, by Tom Clancy This is probably a sign that I’m entering middle age, but yeah this was a fun read. I think I picked this up after Bobby Chesney and Steve Vladek were reminiscing about Clancy novels on the NSL podcast. I didn’t make it through Patriot Games, though, so maybe I still have some youth in me?\nBookshops and Bonedust by Travis Baldree This is a prequel to Legends \u0026 Lattes. If you enjoyed that, you’ll enjoy this one too.\nLord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien Me and my 8-year old have been working our way through these. We finished The Two Towers earlier in the year and will wrap up Return of the King this week. I’m not sure how much he appreciates all the detailed descriptions of the scenery, but he seems to be mostly following the plot. They continue to be perfect.\nA Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson I didn’t learn a ton of new actual science from this (humblebrag). If you have a decent high school or liberal arts education you’ll hopefully be familiar with most of the concepts. But I’d recommend reading it regardless because of all the background on the history and people involved in the discoveries (which my courses didn’t cover) and for the great writing. Also, I just love the idea of trying to cover everything in a single, general-audience book.\nThe Golden Enclaves by Naomi Novik This is the third in the Scholomance trilogy. The first couple were great. The first especially was very fun, almost pop-corn fantasy (despite a lot of death. Like a lot). But this one somehow is way deeper, and in a way that makes you reevaluate the previous books. It’s maybe less “fun” because of where the story goes, but still great. I read this more recently but it’s stuck with me.\nJonathan Strange \u0026 Mr Norell by Susanna Clarke This is a bit hard to review. It does seem to be long (I read it on a Kobo, but wow I see now that Goodreads says 1,006 pages). And while stuff happens, it’s not exactly action packed. Still, I never felt bored reading it, and I was able to follow things clearly the entire time. I think the characters were just so well written that she could bring back a character we haven’t heard from in 400 pages and have us immediately understand who they are and why they’re doing what they’re doing.\nSusanna Clarke also wrote Piranesi which I still think about from time to time, and would highly recommend (despite even less happening in that book).\nThis is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone This was a reread (I needed something short after the tome that was Jonathan Strange \u0026 Mr Norell), but this book had stuck with me since I first read it in 2021. It’s just so, so good. I guess it’s technically a romance set in a Sci-Fi world, which isn’t my usual genera. But I loved it mainly for the writing.\nThe setting is somewhat interesting, but that’s not really the point: two factions are in a struggle spanning multiple universes (“strands”, in the book). Their agents can travel through time and between strands, and embed themselves in various situations to nudge events along a favorable path. I love a good time-travel book, even if they don’t get into the mechanics.\nThe characters are somewhat interesting, but they’re also not really the point. We don’t get ton of detail about them (not even their real names; just get “Red” and “Blue”).\nAnd the plot is also somewhat interesting, but I think still not the point. Stuff happens. They write letters to each other. More stuff happens. They fall in love. More stuff happens.\nTo me, it really comes down to the beautiful writing (with just enough structure around it to make all that flowery prose feel appropriate). I mean… just listen: “I distract myself. I talk of tactics and of methods. I say how I know how I know. I make metaphors to approach the enormous fact of you on slant.”\nOverall, I’d recommend this to just about anyone. Plus, it’s short enough that it’s not a huge time commitment if it’s not your cup of tea.\nOther Some honorable, non-book mentions that I’ve started reading this year:\nThe Money Stuff newsletter from Matt Levine for money stuff The One First newsletter from Steve Steve Vladeck for legal stuff Simon Willison’s blog for AI stuff Marc Brooker’s blog for distributed computing stuff Overall, a solid year! My full list is on Goodreads Reach out to me if you have any questions or recommendations.\n","wordCount":"1117","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-12-11T08:00:00-06:00","dateModified":"2024-12-11T08:00:00-06:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tomaugspurger.net/posts/books-2024/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tomaugspurger.net/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tomaugspurger.net/ accesskey=h title="Tom's Blog (Alt + H)">Tom's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tomaugspurger.net/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomaugspurger.net/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomaugspurger.net/index.xml title=RSS><span>RSS</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tomaugspurger.net/tags title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">My 2024 Year in Books</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-11 08:00:00 -0600 -0600'>December 11, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Here&rsquo;s another Year in Books (I missed last year, but here&rsquo;s <a href=books-2022.md>2022</a>).</p><p>Most of these came from recommendations by friends, <a href=https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/bookclub/><em>The Incomparable</em>&rsquo;s Book
