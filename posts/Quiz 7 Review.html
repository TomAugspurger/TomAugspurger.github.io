<h2>Section A01</h2>
<h3>#1</h3>
<p>The test statistic for $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$ is the $F$ statistic. It's what we'll use for when we're testing multiple parameters at once.</p>
<p>Several people had $\beta_1 = 0$ <strong>or</strong> $\beta_2 = 0$.
This is wrong; it should be <strong>and</strong> not <strong>or</strong>.
This is actually an important difference since the distribution for the $F$ statistic is testing for both slopes simultaneously being zero.</p>
<h3>#2</h3>
<p>This one is similar to #1, except we're testing a single parameter.
That means we want the $t$ statistic.
We want the $t$ from the full model, since we're interested in if winterizing is a significant predictor after accounting for thermostat setting.</p>
<h3>#3</h3>
<p>Standard interpretation for a multiple regression slope.
Make sure to explain that this is the slope for <code>Winter</code>, when holding <code>Therm</code> constant.</p>
<h3>#4</h3>
<p>Similar to #3, but from the simple regression model.
We know we want the simple regression since we're asked for the <em>total effect</em> (not controlling for anything else).</p>
<p>Some people were mixing up the response and the predictor variables in the interpretation.
Remember, the slope is $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. We change $x$ (the predictor) and see how $y$ responds.
To keep the interpretation simple, we change $x$ by one unit. Then the change in $y$ is the estimated slope $\hat{\beta}$.</p>
<h3>#5</h3>
<p>The direct effect is the slope from the full regression model.
It's the direct effect since we've controlled for all the other predictors,
there's nothing else included in the slope.</p>
<h2>Section B42</h2>
<h3>#1</h3>
<p>The test statistic for $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$ is the $F$ statistic. It's what we'll use for when we're testing multiple parameters at once.</p>
<p>Several people had $\beta_1 = 0$ <strong>or</strong> $\beta_2 = 0$ <strong>or</strong> $\beta_3 = 0$.
This is wrong; it should be <strong>and</strong> not <strong>or</strong>.
This is actually an important difference since the distribution for the $F$ statistic is testing for both slopes simultaneously being zero.</p>
<h3>#2</h3>
<p>Be careful to not mix up interpreting slopes vs. interpreting tests. #2 asked for you to interpret the result of a $t$ test: is $X_2$ is significant predictor of $y$, after controlling for the other predictors?</p>
<h3>#3</h3>
<p>Make sure you know what all you're controlling for when interpreting slopes.
For this one the best conservative model only had <code>HSM</code> as a predictor.
That means our interpretation of $\hat{B_1}$ doesn't include controlling for the other predictors.</p>
<p>For the prediction in part <code>c</code>, a lot of people made the same mistake as last week: they reported the point estimate $\hat{y}$, instead of an interval.
The question asked us to estimate with 90% certainty, so we know the answer should be an interval.</p>
<h3>#4</h3>
<p>The population regression equation is</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \epsilon
\end{equation}</p>
<p>where the $\beta_i$'s are unknown.
We want to slice out the subsection of the population with the grades given in the question.
Substitute those in for the $X_i$'s.
This is still a population regression equation (but for a subset of the population), so the $\beta_i$'s are still unknown.</p>
